This is a trial-run to restructure my bug report summarization project as a python oop project.

data\ contains the bug reports and annotated bug reports from 
https://www.cs.ubc.ca/cs-research/softwarepracticeslab/projects/summarizing-software-aftifacts . 
I did a minor alteration by removing the bug report ID=32 from both bugrepots.xml and annotation.xml 
since the annotation.xml was missing annotations from two human annotators. This missing data is 
importatnt to create gold standard summaries as stated in Rastkar et al. (2014). Therefore the data 
set used in here has only 35 bug reports.

More to add on the go...
